    "Hi everyone!<p>Lots of info here, so read to the end and please save this email:<p>This Saturday, May 1st, you will all receive an invitation to the private Wordpress site I use for the Fast Flash Workshop. Please accept the invite and go have a look around! There will be a place for you to introduce yourselves to the other workshop participants (reply to my <b>Welcome, Introduce Yourselves</b> on the Post Your Work & Give Feedback page). Take note of the menu items at the top of the page: About, Daily Craft Articles, Exercises and Prompts, Inspirations/Reading, Post Your Work and Give Feedback.<p>We begin <b>MONDAY, MAY 3rd</b>. The class will run over the course of ten days (with the two weekend days <b>off</b>) and will conclude on <b>FRIDAY, MAY 14</b>.<p>This is a fast paced and generative workshop. You will write lots!<p><b>**Note: Amazing flash writer, teacher, and editor, K.B. Carle, will teach the lesson Friday, May 7th**</b><p>I will be posting each dayâ€™s materials the evening before in the U.S. (this accommodates early morning writers and writers from overseas). I will email you to let you know that the craft article, exercise, and inspiration/reading have been posted.<p>My preference is that you not fuss too much over the exercises and aim to write and post yours within 24 hrs. of receiving the prompt. This will be different for everyone as we are on different time zones and different life schedules. No set deadline, just post your work when you can and (hopefully, if you have time) read and comment on the other posted stories.<p>One key aspect of my workshop is that all feedback is POSITIVE in nature. We are not here to critique, rather to encourage and cheer each other on. I feel very strongly this is the best way to stay <b><i>in the zone</i></b> and keep churning out fresh drafts. This will be new to some of you, but you are going to have to trust me on this. ðŸ™‚<p>You will all be invited to the site as <b><i>authors</i></b> meaning you can post and edit your own stories. We will be using Post Your Work & Give Feedback for the working part of the course. To post your story, go up to the drop down menu on the upper left of the page and go to <b>Blog Posts</b> and click on <b>Add.</b> I will ask you to always put your name in the title section of your post.<p> I'm excited to get started! Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns/glitches so we can address them before workshop begins.<p><p>Cheers,<br>Kathy<p><p>Art of Flash Fiction: https://artofflashfiction.substack.com/<p>Website: kathy-fish.com<p>Twitter: @kathyfish",
